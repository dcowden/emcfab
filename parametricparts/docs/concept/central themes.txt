Central Themes/ Ideas

* Only high quality, parametric models
    * export stl but fixed first
	* first to market with AMF if possible
    * stronger CAD engine than openscad
	
* User can customize and download
    * initially parameters
	* ideally pictoral help
	
* Model authors have a reason to contribute
	--> money ( but we take 5% )
	--> access to a certain number of downloads for each model uploaded?
	
*  Print directly from here
	* shapeways, cubify, redeye, etc
	* far future: producers can sign up too ?
